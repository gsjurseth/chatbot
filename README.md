# chatbot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tenfourty/chatbot.png)](https://travis-ci.org/tenfourty/chatbot)

chatbot is a bot for Apigee's slack instance built on the [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com) (pronounced hew-bot) framework. It was
initially generated by Jeremy Brown and has been setup to run on OpenShift and talks to Slack via the slack-irc gateway so it appears as a real person.

### How to Contribute

All contributions are more than welcome and easy!

1. fork this repository
1. work locally on your contribution, see running chatbot locally below for how to run it on your own machine
1. check your changes in and push to your repository
1. submit a pull request back to tenfourty/chatbot
  - you can see your pull request being built in [travis-ci under pull requests](https://travis-ci.org/tenfourty/chatbot/pull_requests)
1. one of the admins will review your pull request and accept it
1. once your pull request has been accepted your code will be built again by travis-ci, this time from the master branch
  - you can see your build happening in [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/tenfourty/chatbot)
1. once your build is done it will be deployed to dev_chatbot, which is running here - [http://dev.apigee-chatbot.me/](http://dev.apigee-chatbot.me/)
1. dev_chatbot will appear in the following rooms in slack:
  - #general (no way to turn this off, but it should be muted)
  - #chatbot-dev
  - #chatbot-test
  - and of course you can private message it as well
1. do any live testing of dev_chatbot but please try to only use the #chatbot-test room as we don't want to mess up the other rooms.
1. once you are happy with how it is working get one of the chatbot GitHub admins to tag the new version in the GitHub repo, this will trigger a new build in travis-ci that will deploy to the main chatbot that is sitting in all the rooms.
  - you can see the build & deploy in [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/tenfourty/chatbot)
  - chatbot is running here - [http://www.apigee-chatbot.me/](http://www.apigee-chatbot.me/)

### Running chatbot locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start chatbot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    chatbot>

Then you can interact with chatbot by typing `chatbot help`.

    chatbot> chatbot help
    chatbot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    chatbot help - Displays all of the help commands that chatbot knows about.
    ...

### Configuration

A few scripts (including some installed by default) require environment
variables to be set as a simple form of configuration.

Each script should have a commented header which contains a "Configuration"
section that explains which values it requires to be placed in which variable.
When you have lots of scripts installed this process can be quite labour
intensive. The following shell command can be used as a stop gap until an
easier way to do this has been implemented.

    grep -o 'hubot-[a-z0-9_-]\+' external-scripts.json | \
      xargs -n1 -I {} sh -c 'sed -n "/^# Configuration/,/^#$/ s/^/{} /p" \
          $(find node_modules/{}/ -name "*.coffee")' | \
        awk -F '#' '{ printf "%-25s %s\n", $1, $2 }'

How to set environment variables will be specific to your operating system.
Rather than recreate the various methods and best practices in achieving this,
it's suggested that you search for a dedicated guide focused on your OS.

### Secrets

TODO - document secrets. speak to an admin for now... will update this asap.

### Scripting

An example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to
get started, along with the [Scripting Guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md).

For many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just
the thing.

### external-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead of
writing it yourself, you can use existing plugins.

Hubot is able to load plugins from third-party `npm` packages. This is the
recommended way to add functionality to your hubot. You can get a list of
available hubot plugins on [npmjs.com](npmjs) or by using `npm search`:

    % npm search hubot-scripts panda
    NAME             DESCRIPTION                        AUTHOR DATE       VERSION KEYWORDS
    hubot-pandapanda a hubot script for panda responses =missu 2014-11-30 0.9.2   hubot hubot-scripts panda
    ...


To use a package, check the package's documentation, but in general it is:

1. Use `npm install --save` to add the package to `package.json` and install it
2. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string

You can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.

##### Advanced Usage

It is also possible to define `external-scripts.json` as an object to
explicitly specify which scripts from a package should be included. The example
below, for example, will only activate two of the six available scripts inside
the `hubot-fun` plugin, but all four of those in `hubot-auto-deploy`.

```json
{
  "hubot-fun": [
    "crazy",
    "thanks"
  ],
  "hubot-auto-deploy": "*"
}
```

**Be aware that not all plugins support this usage and will typically fallback
to including all scripts.**

### hubot-scripts

Before hubot plugin packages were adopted, most plugins were held in the
[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] package. Some of these plugins have yet to be
migrated to their own packages. They can still be used but the setup is a bit
different.

To enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with
extension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this
repo.
